		<p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Dear Members,<br/><b>Welcome to this new issue of our newsletter!</b><br/>
			&emsp;Spring is finally here, bringing longer days, blooming flowers, and more sunshine to brighten up our routines 🌤️🌸<br/>
			&emsp;We’re just a few days away from a well-deserved Easter break, so hang in there! Whether you're wrapping up assignments or preparing for exams, you’ve got this 💪🍀<br/>
			&emsp;In this issue, you’ll find a recap of what we’ve been up to lately, including guest lectures, seminars, and social gatherings 🧺👒 We’re also excited to share what’s coming up next: be ready for other fun social events and thought-provoking talks and workshops. Then, a member of our funding team will introduce to you a handy study tool that might just become your new academic best friend; finally, our Research Spotlight will dive into the latest developments in the world of genomics.<br/>
			&emsp;Happy reading, and as always, don’t hesitate to reach out or get involved—we’d love to hear from you!</i></p>

			<p>&emsp;This early spring has been a time full of activity, growth, and connection for our association… and we couldn’t be happier about it! <br/>
				&emsp;We've been receiving lots of positive feedback, spotting new faces at our events, and watching our community come together to learn, share, and support one another 💫</p>
			<p>&emsp;We kicked things off with another insightful session in our <b>guest lecture series</b>, this time with <b>Professor Roncarati</b>, who guided us through the fascinating world of <b>CRISPR systems</b>.</p>
			<p>&emsp;The unpredictable weather had other plans for our <b>social event</b> at first, but we certainly did not give that up easily! <br/>
				&emsp;On its second try, the <b>Spring Picnic</b> of this past Saturday was a huge success: with around 40 people in attendance, games, snacks, music, and plenty of sunshine, it turned out to be a truly wonderful afternoon 💚 <br/>
				&emsp;A big thank you to everyone who joined and made it such a fun and memorable day: we’re already looking forward to the next one! 👀 </p>
			<p>&emsp;Finally, put president Carolina led the engaging <b>"Learn How to Learn"</b> workshop, where we explored effective study strategies backed by scientific research -turning study time into smart time!</p>
			<p>&emsp;<b>📢 Another big milestone is just around the corner! We are so close to reaching the 100 signatures needed to officially register NextGen Biotech!</b></p>

		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Let’s be honest: attending lectures, taking notes, and listening carefully to professors are crucial, but for biotechnology and genomics students, they’re rarely enough. <b>To truly grasp and retain complex material, self-study plays a huge role</b>.<br/>
			    &emsp;However, reading textbooks or going through long presentations can be time-consuming, especially during exam season.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;That’s why I’d like to recommend the <b>“Andrey K” YouTube channel</b>. Even though it’s no longer actively updated, the existing videos remain incredibly useful. <br/>
			    &emsp;They offer <b>quick yet detailed explanations of many biological and chemical processes, all supported by helpful visuals and diagrams</b>. The way <b>topics are broken down</b> makes them much easier to understand and remember.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Personally, I often turn to this channel before exams for a quick refresher. As a Genomics student, my studies combine biology, chemistry, statistics, programming, and more. It’s a lot to keep in your head over multiple semesters, especially as new topics start to build on past ones. <br/>
			    &emsp;That’s where this channel helps: it <b>brings older content back into focus in a simple and engaging way</b>.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;For example, while preparing for my metabolomics exam last semester, I used one of the videos to review the citric acid cycle -a topic full of enzymes, intermediate compounds, and energy transfers that can be hard to recall in detail.<br/>
			    &emsp;The <b>clear structure and visuals</b> made the process much easier to understand and remember.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;If you're looking for a <b>fast, visual, and reliable way to reinforce your understanding</b>, I highly recommend checking out “Andrey K” on YouTube. It’s a <b>great tool for refreshing your memory and boosting your confidence before exams</b>.</p>

		<p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Each month, we will highlight one of the research areas our department is involved in, aiming to encourage you to read, explore and discover your own interests.</i></p>
                <p style="color:black">&emsp;This month, we focus on <b>genomics</b> —a relatively recent but rapidly growing research field.<br/>
		&emsp;One notable piece of recent news in this domain involves the company <b>23andMe</b>, which filed for bankruptcy this month. <br/>
			&emsp;For those unfamiliar with the company, 23andMe is best known for its <b>direct-to-consumer genetic testing service</b>. Customers provide a saliva sample that is analyzed in a laboratory using single nucleotide polymorphism <b>(SNP) genotyping</b> to generate <b>reports on ancestry and genetic predispositions</b> to various health-related conditions.</p>
		<p style="color:black">&emsp;The primary controversy surrounding 23andMe has been related to <b>privacy concerns</b>. Genetic information is highly sensitive, revealing not only personal details but also information about one's family. Such data should only be shared with trustworthy entities.<br/>
			&emsp;Unfortunately, 23andMe failed to be a such entity, making a profit from the private information of its many customers, without even giving them much useful results. It’s also worth mentioning the <b>data breach from 2023</b> when they were hacked, and <b>the information of 7 million of their customers got leaked</b>.</p>
		<p style="color:black">&emsp;To learn more about this important story, we highly recommend you to check out this insightful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/27/geneticist-mourn-23andme-useless-health-information"><b><i>Guardian</i> article</b></a>.</p>
		<p style="color:black">&emsp;For more uplifting and exciting information about genomics, we encourage you to explore the work of the many <a href="https://fabit.unibo.it/en/research/research-areas/genomics"><b>research groups</b></a> at our university.</p>
