			    &emsp;I'm here to share insights on a piece of literature that, while admittedly intimidating at first (its sheer size—over 650 pages!—might make you hesitate), quickly proves itself to be an absolute masterpiece, weaving together science, history, and storytelling in a way that makes every page worth reading.</i></p>
		    <center><p><b>&emsp;Non-fiction Book Recommendation - from Sofia:<br/>
			    ‘She has her mother’s laugh - the powers, perversions, and potential of heredity’, by Carl Zimmer</b></p></center>

		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Why do children look like their parents? Mendelian genetics offers a clear answer. But what about the ways they don’t? Why can siblings be so different from one another? And does heredity stop at DNA, or is there more to the story? If you’ve ever found yourself wondering about these questions, <i>She Has Her Mother’s Laugh</i> by Carl Zimmer is the perfect book for you.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;Zimmer takes the familiar concept of <b>inheritance</b> and stretches it far <b>beyond the boundaries of DNA</b>, exploring how our understanding of heredity has evolved from ancient misconceptions to cutting-edge genomic research. Rather than treating genetics as a simple set of rules, he reveals a much richer, more complex picture: one where mutations, epigenetics, and even the microbes we carry play a role in shaping who we are. <b>His storytelling blends history, science, and thought-provoking ethical questions, making for an engaging and deeply insightful read.</b></p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;As a genomics student, I was particularly fascinated by his discussion of genetic ‘chimeras’: the idea is that an individual isn’t necessarily made up of identical cells with the same DNA. Mutations and variations can arise during development, meaning that different parts of our body might have slightly different genetic codes. This concept challenges the traditional view of a singular, fixed genome and highlights just how dynamic biology truly is. Zimmer’s ability to <b>unpack such complex ideas in an accessible and compelling way</b> is what makes this book a must-read.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;For students and science enthusiasts alike, <i>She Has Her Mother’s Laugh</i> is a reminder that genetics is far more than just Punnett squares and inheritance charts. It’s a <b>story that intersects with medicine, history, and ethics</b>; one that <b>shapes not just our biology, but our identities and societies</b>. Whether you’re passionate about DNA, curious about the future of genetic research, or simply enjoy a well-told science story, this book is an enriching and thought-provoking read.</p>

                <p style="color:black">&emsp;Recent years have seen significant progress in cancer treatments, including ongoing initiatives to develop a cancer vaccine. As noted in this  <a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2024/12/30/cancer-vaccines-golden-age-of-cancer-research/">article</a>, cancer vaccines “aren’t new: Cancer Research UK-funded science led to the development of the HPV vaccine, which has helped reduce cervical cancer cases by nearly 90% in women in their twenties who received the vaccine at age 12–13.” But, with very recent substantial investments in AI infrastructures that could boost the process, we should definitely keep an eye on the news about cancer vaccines.
